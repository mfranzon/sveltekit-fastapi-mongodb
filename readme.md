## SvelteKit - FastAPI - MongoDB with Docker project template
Please note that this project is still in progress. Some features are incomplete or completely missing. The goal is to build this into a project template similar to what [Sebastián Ramírez](https://github.com/tiangolo) provides [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql).

## Credit where credit is due
A few existing existing project templates were referenced while building this. This project is heavily influenced by these projects:
- [FastAPI MongoDB Real World Example](https://github.com/markqiu/fastapi-mongodb-realworld-example-app)
- [FastAPI Project Template](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/project-generation/)

## A Note on SvelteKit
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is in public beta (at the time of this writing on 6/20/21). Many changes (including breaking changes) are expected as the Svelte team works towards version 1.
