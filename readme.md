## SvelteKit - FastAPI - MongoDB with Docker project template
Please note that this project is still in progress. Some features are incomplete or completely missing. The goal is to build this into a project template similar to what [Sebastián Ramírez](https://github.com/tiangolo) provides [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql).

## Credit where credit is due
A few existing existing project templates were referenced while building this. This project is heavily influenced by these projects:
